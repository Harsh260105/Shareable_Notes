A modern, AI-powered note-taking application with advanced insights using Google Gemini API.

> **This is a robust mini project, built in just about a week, to showcase best practices in React, Redux (with persistent storage), and deep AI integration.**
>
> ## üí™ Technical Achievement
>
> **The rich text editor is built ENTIRELY FROM SCRATCH‚Äîno Quill, no TinyMCE, no Draft.js, no ready-made editors whatsoever. Just pure JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation. While this may not look like much at first glance, building a fully functional rich text editor from the ground up represents significant technical effort and deep understanding of web fundamentals.**

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- [React](https://react.dev/) with Redux and [redux-persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) for state management and persistence
- **100% CUSTOM JavaScript implementation for the rich text editor** - No Quill, no Draft.js, no TinyMCE, or any other text editor library was used. This demonstrates deep understanding of DOM manipulation and browser APIs
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and building
- [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) for AI text analysis
- [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) for local storage
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling

## üîß Technical Details

### Custom Rich Text Editor

The centerpiece of this project is the entirely custom-built rich text editor. While it would have been much easier to use an existing solution like Quill.js, Draft.js, or TinyMCE, building one from scratch presented a significant technical challenge that demonstrates deep understanding of:

- DOM manipulation and content-editable behavior
- Selection APIs and range manipulation
- Event handling for complex user interactions
- State management for undo/redo functionality
- Custom formatting commands without relying on third-party code

This implementation showcases true front-end development skills by creating something most developers would simply import from a library.

## üîë Environment Variables

- `VITE_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key for accessing AI features

---

## ü§ñ AI/NLP Features

This application uses Google Gemini API to provide the following natural language processing features:

- **Key Term Extraction:** Identifies important concepts, entities, and terms in your notes
- **Grammar Checking:** Highlights grammar and spelling issues with suggested corrections
- **Summarization:** Generates concise summaries of your notes
- **Word Cloud:** Creates a visual representation of the most important terms
- **Related Notes:** Finds semantically similar notes based on content

---

## üìÑ Usage

- Create a new note using the "+" button
- Edit notes with the **from-scratch custom rich text editor** (formatting, styling, and editing all implemented with pure JavaScript)
- Pin/unpin notes for quick access
- Use the AI Insights panel to analyze your notes
- Switch between dark and light themes
